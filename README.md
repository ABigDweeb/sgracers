# Splitgate Race Leaderboard Browser

in an effort to maintain as much of splitgate 1 as we can, this website has been created to host the race leaderboards for the game for the forseeable future through the user of custom servers that will be released in the future

- through use of Adam & Ruby's [SplitgateTools](https://github.com/Splitgate/SplitgateTools) mod, send race pbs directly to the website to save best times and update leaderboards - get started downloading the mod [here](https://sgracers.vercel.app/how-to)
- server & client side cheat detection to prevent submitting fraudulent times
- online leaderboard browser for all 42 splitgate race maps
- individual stat lookup, compare stats, evaluation of all racers, & more
- every world record video compiled to one page
