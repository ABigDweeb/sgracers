# Splitgate Race Leaderboard Browser

in an effort to maintain as much of splitgate 1 as we can, this website has been created to host the race leaderboards for the game for the forseeable future through the user of custom servers that will be released in the future

- online leaderboard browser for all 42 splitgate race maps
- individual stat lookup, evaluation of all racers, data views of all positions & times, etc.
- random race picker with filters to hone in selections and improvement
- api handles new personal bests by saving pbs and updates leaderboard automatically
- api to use the website's custom leaderboards in-game
- displays the full leaderboard (past top 10) for the "friend" leaderboard
